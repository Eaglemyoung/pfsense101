> pfSense is an open source firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD.[4][5][6] It is installed on a physical computer or a virtual machine to make a dedicated firewall/router for a network and has been noted for its reliability[7] and offering a range of features.[8][9] It can be configured and upgraded through a web-based interface, and requires no knowledge of the underlying FreeBSD system to manage.[8][10] pfSense is commonly deployed as a perimeter firewall, router, wireless access point, DHCP server, DNS server, and as a VPN endpoint. pfSense supports installation of third-party packages like Snort or Squid through its Package Manager.
